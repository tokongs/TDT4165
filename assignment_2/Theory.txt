Task2)
The mdc works by applying the rules of RPN on a valid input. It crate lexems from the input string
and tokens from the lexemes. It then applies the correct operations to the tokens. To do this we take out the foremost
element of the token list and pushes it onto a stack. It does this until we get an operator. When we get an operator
we apply the operator to the two topmost elements of the stack and push the result back again. This is done until there
are no more operands in the token list or the stack.
